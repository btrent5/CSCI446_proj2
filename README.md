Flow Free Constraint Satisfaction Problem

## Running
The program defaults to running the smart algorithm with the puzzles located at "res/puzzles" and outputting to "res/output".
The first argument passed will set the the puzzle location, the second argument passed will set the output location, and if "true" is passed the program uses the naive search algorithm.
